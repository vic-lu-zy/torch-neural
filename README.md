# torch-neural
A collection of Deep Learning method built on Torch7 for analyzing neural signals.

## Contribution
All interested public are invited to contribute to this repository.

## Data
The training and testing data are restricted to openly available neural data such as 
  * EEG
  * ECoG
  * MEG
  * fMRI
  * LFP
  * fNIRS
  * others (suggestions are welcomed)

## Goal
The goal of the project is to apply deep learning methods on the neural data in order to decode or predict the subject's behaviours such as
  * Physical movements
  * Cognitive states
  * Attention/Intention
  * Memory encoding

## How
The main approach is to exploit the time series signals to train RNN/LSTM with respect to the decoding targets.
